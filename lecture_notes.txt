* Merge between the work of each participant in a Unity project is so difficult and challenging !!! be careful
* we should make our games work on all platforms, same gameplay!
* exercise will be checked on pressed PCs.
* the flower position should be added by cannon direction * flower_speed * Time.deltaTime, 
   the speed should be computed as the formula of distance and time (distance/time something like that).
* don't destroy gameobject, setactive(false) then activate it again, save it in some array or "pool" 
   then take it again and activate it again
