This project was part of the Game Development Jam Course at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

The project talks about spaceship game, 
the spaceship moves in space, by the up down left right arrows buttons,
and collects diamonds and when collecting diamonds the score rises.

I have added some sheep to the game, they fly randomly, random directions and speed, 
the red ones are evil sheep, if they hit you (spaceship) you'll lose 3 points.

If you collect the yellow diamonds you'll get 1 point, 
blue ones gets you 2 points 
and red ones gets you 3 points, 
when you collect a diamond it will appear randomly in another position in the game, 
and so for the sheep, you can fire them with laser beam, 
when they get hit with the laser beam they will randomly appear in another position, after a certain time (seconds).

Your score appears on the top of the screen, the elapsed time from the beginning of the game appears in the left top of the screen (in red).
